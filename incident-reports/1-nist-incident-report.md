## Overview
This document serves as a template for analyzing incident reports using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. It provides a structured format to record findings, apply the NIST framework to various scenarios, and document reflections or notes from activities or lessons learned. This markdown version is designed for easy sharing and collaboration on a GitHub repository.

## NIST Framework Analysis

### Summary
*Provide a brief overview of the incident or activity being analyzed. Include key details such as the context, scope, and objectives of the analysis.*

### Identify
*Document the assets, systems, or processes involved in the incident. Highlight risks, vulnerabilities, or critical elements that need to be addressed.*

### Protect
*Outline the safeguards or controls that were in place or could be implemented to mitigate risks. Include policies, training, or technical measures.*

### Detect
*Describe the methods or tools used to identify the incident. Highlight any monitoring systems, alerts, or indicators of compromise observed.*

### Respond
*Detail the actions taken to address the incident. Include containment strategies, communication plans, or mitigation efforts.*

### Recover
*Explain the steps taken to restore systems or processes after the incident. Include recovery plans, lessons learned, or improvements made.*

## Reflections/Notes
*Use this section to capture additional thoughts, lessons learned, or reflections on the activity or incident. This can include insights on the effectiveness of the NIST framework, challenges faced, or areas for improvement.*

*Note: If applicable, reference any associated images or diagrams (e.g., `image1.png`) to support your analysis. Ensure images are uploaded to the repository and linked appropriately.*
